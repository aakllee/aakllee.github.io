      <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings all, to the first post on this here website—a website born&#xA;not of love, but of hate, vice, and sin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that&amp;rsquo;s not to say that I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken care in creating this&#xA;site. Quite the opposite, I intend to populate it with quality&#xA;writings and updates. The likes of which I am now unable to post on&#xA;LinkedIn, which has &amp;ldquo;temporarily restricted&amp;rdquo; my account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now why was it temporarily restricted I hear you ask? Well, one day I&#xA;thought to connect my account with my university Outlook profile, and&#xA;then the next I was logged out of my account. Which happens, major&#xA;account changes tend to trigger such things for security—password&#xA;changes for example. But the issue was attempting to log back&#xA;in. Which required me to fill in a dozen captchas, and surrender my&#xA;phone number for &amp;ldquo;verification&amp;rdquo; (the villains never even had my phone&#xA;number before, in what world does using one here verify&#xA;anything?). And then, oh what a surprise I just get taken back to the&#xA;login screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
