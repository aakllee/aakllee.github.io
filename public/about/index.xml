      <description>Hello, my name is Aaron; I am an incoming PKPD industrial placement student at AstraZeneca, and a student at the University of Warwick. I study a combination of computer science, biomedical and systems engineering, and molecular and systems biology.
My main interests lie in synthetic/engineering biology, in the application of computational and engineering methods to biomedical and clinical sciences.
Engineering biology is a field I have been passionate about since very early on in my lifeâ€”I was first exposed to genetic engineering in year 8 (2018), with the release of Justin Atkin&amp;rsquo;s presentation of his DIY lactose intolerance gene therapy, and subsequent spider silk-producing yeast.</description>
