      <description>From February to October 2024, I competed in the international Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competitionâ€”where competitors developed engineered biological solutions for a variety of problem spaces.
I was a member of the 2024 University of Warwick team, BEACON, working together to engineer bacteria with the abilities to scavenge for rare earth metals, then to transport them to a singular point for collection to be recycled. We were one of 210 teams1 to be awarded a gold medal at the Paris Jamboree.</description>
