      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past 10 years or so, I have been suffering from moderate&#xA;eczema. As anyone with eczema would know, this is incredibly&#xA;irritating to deal with, and practically impossible to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we can try. So with the topical corticosteroids prescribed by my&#xA;doctor only serving to temporarily quell the condition, with a risk of&#xA;withdrawal syndrome, I elected to look for other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Helge Bjørnå and Birger Kaada (1987) describe an experimental&#xA;treatment by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). These&#xA;are available to consumers as a TENS unit, which is a little box with&#xA;dials that can control the strength and frequency of electrical pulses&#xA;sent to pads attached to your skin. This was intended to improve&#xA;circulation in the skin and thus promote healing and relief of&#xA;itching. After 2 years, they observed significant improvement in both,&#xA;though this was only tested in a singular patient.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
