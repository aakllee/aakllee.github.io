      <description>From February to October 2024, I competed in the international Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition, where competitors developed engineered biological solutions for a variety of problem spaces.
I was a member of the 2024 University of Warwick team, BEACON, working together to engineer bacteria with the abilities to scavenge for rare earth metals, then to transport them to a singular point for collection to be recycled. We were one of 210 teams to be awarded a gold medal at the Paris Jamboree.</description>

      <description>Hello, my name is Aaron; I am an incoming PKPD industrial placement student at AstraZeneca, and a student at the University of Warwick. I study a combination of computer science, biomedical and systems engineering, and molecular and systems biology.
My main interests lie in synthetic/engineering biology, in the application of computational and engineering methods to biomedical and clinical sciences.
Engineering biology is a field I have been passionate about since very early on in my lifeâ€”I was first exposed to genetic engineering in year 8 (2018), with the release of Justin Atkin&amp;rsquo;s presentation of his DIY lactose intolerance gene therapy, and subsequent spider silk-producing yeast.</description>
